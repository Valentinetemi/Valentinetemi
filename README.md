## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 17-year-old 300L CS student on a mission to become a robotics engineer. I've wanted to build robots since I was a kid – machines that move, think, and make life easier.

Right now, I'm building the foundation: **DSA, mathematics, AI, and robotics fundamentals** – learning everything I need to turn that childhood dream into reality.

**Current Focus:** Building **TracelyAI** – an AI-powered waste sorting system for Nigeria. It's my training ground for combining software (computer vision) with hardware (robotics).

**Journey:** Day X/100 of #100DaysOfBuildingAI 🔥

## 💼 What I'm Building

### 🤖 TracelyAI – AI Brain for Waste Sorting Robots

**The Problem:**  
Nigeria generates **32+ million tonnes** of waste annually but recycles less than 20%. Most facilities use manual sorting or can't operate because automation is too expensive.

**The Solution:**  
Building an AI system that detects and classifies waste materials (plastic, aluminum, glass) – the "brain" that will eventually power automated sorting robots.

**Current Stage:**
- ✅ Built proof-of-concept YOLOv8 detection model
- 🔄 Training on Nigerian waste data
- 📚 Learning robotics fundamentals (Arduino, servos, mechanics)
- 🎯 Goal: Complete AI + hardware simulation by Day 100

## 📚 Learning Journey (Day 61/100)

**What I'm Currently Learning:**

### 🧮 Mathematics Foundations
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Calculus (derivatives, gradients, optimization)
- Why: 80% of ML and robotics is mathematical optimization

### 🔗 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Implementing DSA concepts from my 300L CS course
- Building: Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.
- Pushing daily implementations to GitHub

### 🤖 Robotics Fundamentals  
- Arduino programming and simulations
- Servo motor control
- Sensor integration
- Path planning algorithms

### 👁️ Computer Vision & ML
- YOLOv8 object detection
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and optimization
- Real-time inference

**Approach:** Foundation first. Build deep knowledge so when I build the complete robot, it's built right.
