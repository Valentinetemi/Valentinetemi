## ðŸš€ What I'm Building

### TracelyAI - AI Waste Detection for Nigerian Recycling

Automating waste sorting using computer vision trained on Nigerian waste materials.

**The Problem:** Nigeria generates 32M tonnes of waste annually. <20% is recycled. Manual sorting is slow and expensive.

**The Solution:** Real-time AI detection system for conveyor belt sorting at recycling facilities.

**Status:**
- âœ… Proof-of-concept validated
- ðŸ”„ Training on Nigerian-specific waste data
- ðŸ“ˆ Building in public (Day 32 of #100DaysOfBuildingAI)
